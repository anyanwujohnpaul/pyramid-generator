<h2>Pyramid Generator</h2>

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that you can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.

In this practice project, I learned fundamental of programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Pyramid Generator. I worked with arrays, strings, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more to build a <strong>Pyramid Generator</strong>.
